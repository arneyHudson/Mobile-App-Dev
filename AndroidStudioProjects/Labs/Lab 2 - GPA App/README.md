The app is fully functioning aside from snackbars not working.
You can add up to 7 classes (I picked this because I've met someone who had 7)
You have to input all aspects in order for the course to "add"
Only positive numbers can be added to credits, and only letters and positive numbers can be added to grades
I gave users the option to put in a percentage or a letter grade
Also added a reset button to clear everything
Orientation changes wont change the data that is saved because I used a ViewModel
